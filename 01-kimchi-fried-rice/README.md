# Kimchi Fried Rice

This is a very versatile recipe. My mother used to cook fried rice for our family occasionally in order to deal with left over vegetables and extra rice. Surprisingly this might be the only recipe that the taste would not be better if you use freshly cooked rice. Left over rice is drier, and this is a plus for cooking fried rice. In the process of cooking, we would be adding a lot of fresh vegetables which contains more water.

## Ingredients

### Main

- 1.5 Cups of White Rice (Sushi Rice Preferred, Jasmine Rice acceptable)
- 2-3 Pieces of Mushroom (I used Shitake Mushroom)
- Half Yellow Bell Pepper
- Half Red Bell Pepper
- 1 Fish Sausage
- 1 Piece of Smoked Five Spice Tofu
- 2 Eggs
- 1-2 Scallion or Green Onion
- Kimchi
- Salted Spicy Radish (Not really necessary, but I like the flavor)

### Sauce 

- Salt
- White Pepper
- Shaoxin Cooking Wine, you can substituted it with other cooking wine
- Soy Sauce
- MSG（I used the Japanese brand called 味の素, you can find more about MSG from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monosodium_glutamate). If you don't have it, you could use veggie stock or chicken stock instead.

## How-to?

### Cooking the Rice

- If you have white rice from Chinese takeout, great! You can skip this step. If you don't have any ready cooked rice, and you have a rice cooker, do like you usually do to cook rice. Use a little bit less water to make the rice drier. If you have no rice cooker, and don't have left over rice, let's make some now. In a small pot. combine rice and some water. Heat to boiling on high. Once boiling, cover and reduce the heat to low. Cook 12-14 minutes or until the water has been absorbed and rice is tender. Turn of the heat and fluff the cooked rice with a fork.


### Prepare the ingredients

- Wash all fresh vegetables you have, and dice them into almost equal squares

- Crack the eggs and beat them into state that it looks consistent. 

- Cut off and discard the root ends of the scallion; and thinly slice it. Don't need to separate the white bottom and green tops. 

- Slice fish sausage into small round pieces and put them in a small bowl.

- Cut smoked tofu into small squares just like the vegetables.

### Cooking Fried Rice

- In a large pan (nonstick, if you have one. If you have wok, even better), add 2 teaspoons of oil (Sunflower oil preferred) on medium high until hot. Add the diced mushroom, tofu, red and yellow pepper, cook 2-3 minutes, add fish sausage and salt spiced radish. Continue cook for 1 minutes or until it looks golden brown. 

- Add rice and stir occasionally to make it cover with oil evenly. Now add the beaten eggs and stir. Add kimchi and add salt, white pepper, Shaoxin Rice wine, a drizle of soy sauce to make the color looks darker.  Stir, and after 1-2 minutes, add scallion (both bottom and green tops) and MSG. MSG should already comes last. And taste before and after your dish when adding MSG. 

- Cook until the rice is dry and crispy. 

- Now plate it in your bowl and enjoy your meal.
